# C Programming Language

This repository is just a collection of code and exercises based on the second edition of the 
famous book by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie - "C Programming Language. ANSI C".

# How to run code

This part of README doument is likely to change over time. For now, I am using `gcc` compiler, I
am simply compiling the file that I want to run one by one, like so:

```c
cc -o hello hello.c
```

This will produce a binary machine code executable `hello` that you can execute, e.g.:


```shell
./hello
```
